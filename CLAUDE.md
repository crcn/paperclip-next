# Claude Rules for paperclip-next

## PLATINUM RULE: TDD (Test-Driven Development)

**ALWAYS write a failing test FIRST before writing any fix.**

1. Write a test that demonstrates the bug (it must FAIL)
2. Run the test to confirm it fails
3. Write the minimum code to make the test pass
4. Run the test to confirm it passes
5. Refactor if needed

NO EXCEPTIONS. Do not write fixes without a failing test first. This is non-negotiable.
